# W2 Project - Data cleaning & wrangling

The goal of this project is to combine everything i have learned about data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas so i can see how it all works together. For this project, i will start with this messy data set Shark Attack. I will need to download it, import it, use your data wrangling skills to clean it up, prepare it to be analyzed, and then export it as a clean CSV data file

The main idea is the types of sharks that had attacked along the history. So I tried to clean and fill nulls values.
 

## How to deliver the project

1. Files that you can find inside
   - Include a `.gitignore`
   - At least 1 jupyter notebook
   - Including functions in a `src.py`
